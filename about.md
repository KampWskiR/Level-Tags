# Level Tags

A simple mod that adds tags to levels indicating their style, gameplay, and more.

<cr>The mod is still in alpha, so if you run into any bugs or have feedback, feel free to DM me on Discord @kampwski</cr>

You can also join the moderation team if you're good at recognizing deco and gameplay styles.
